# Chess.com API Data Extraction

## Overview
This project aims to extract game-related data, including games and moves, from the Chess.com website using their REST API. The API provides endpoints to access various information related to users' games, moves, and more.

## Prerequisites
1. **Chess.com Developer Account**: Obtain API access credentials by registering on the Chess.com Developer Portal and obtaining an API key.
2. **Programming Language**: Python 3.x or higher.
3. **Required Libraries**: `requests` for making HTTP requests, `json` for handling JSON data.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

## Usage
1. **Set Up API Key**: Place your Chess.com API key in the designated field in the configuration file or use environment variables for security purposes.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `extract_chess_data.py` to begin the data extraction process.
    ```bash
    python extract_chess_data.py
    ```
3. **Parameters**: Modify the script to specify the user whose data you want to extract, additional filters, or specific data endpoints.
   
## Structure
- `extract_chess_data.py`: Python script to interact with the Chess.com API and extract game-related data.
